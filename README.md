# Lab Management System

The Lab Management System is a comprehensive and user-friendly software application designed to streamline the management of laboratory equipment inventory. It is built using C++ programming language and incorporates a range of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including inheritance, polymorphism, pure virtual functions, templates, exception handling, and file handling.

## Key Features

- **Add Lab Equipment**: Users can easily add various types of lab equipment to the inventory, such as centrifuges, spectrophotometers, microscopes, and more. They can input relevant details such as the equipment name, manufacturer, and specific attributes based on the equipment type.

- **Display Inventory**: The system allows users to view the complete inventory of lab equipment. The details of each item, including the equipment name, manufacturer, and specific attributes, are displayed in an organized manner.

- **Search and Filter**: Users can search for specific equipment items using keywords or filter the inventory based on criteria like equipment type, manufacturer, or attributes. This functionality helps in quickly locating and accessing the desired equipment.

- **Update and Remove**: The system provides options to update the information of existing equipment items and remove equipment from the inventory. Users can modify equipment details or delete obsolete items to maintain an accurate and up-to-date inventory.

- **Save and Load**: The inventory can be easily saved to a file in a structured format. Users can load previously saved inventory files to restore previous states or import inventory data from external sources.

- **Error Handling**: The system implements robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptional situations, such as file read/write errors or invalid user inputs. This ensures stability and reliability during the usage of the application.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The Lab Management System features an intuitive and interactive command-line interface (CLI) that guides users through the available functionalities. Clear prompts and informative messages make the system easy to navigate and understand.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: To use the Lab Management System, ensure that you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. Popular options include GCC, Clang, or Visual C++.

2. **Compilation**: Compile the source code files using the appropriate compiler command. For example, using GCC: `g++ main.cpp -o lab_management`.

3. **Execution**: Run the compiled program from the command line or terminal: `./lab_management`. The Lab Management System will start, presenting you with the main menu and available options.

4. **Usage**: Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the Lab Management System. Use the menu options to add equipment, display the inventory, search and filter equipment, update or remove items, and save/load the inventory.

5. **Exit**: Choose the appropriate option in the menu to exit the Lab Management System when you are done.
